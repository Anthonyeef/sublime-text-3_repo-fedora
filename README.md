Create a easy way to install sublime text 3 in fedora via command line

This is an easy way to install sublime text 3 via command line. I simply wrote a script file to install the lastest version of sublime text 3.

A little bug is I can't see the icon after I successfully installing it. Waiting to be fix.

And if there is a new version updated, I will keep this script update(if I remember:)

**how to install**

1. download this install file
2. open the terminal and go to the folder you download the file
3. run `su -c "sh install-sublime-text.sh"`
4. enjoy :)
